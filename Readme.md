<h3 align="left">Project Description</h3>

this project consists of making a calculator using a Raspberry pi4 card, a 4x4 keyboard and an LCD display. 
In addition, I linked this calculator to a graphical interface created under Tkinter so that there is interaction between the 4x4 keyboard, 
the lcd and the interface. And finally I used 3D design to create a enclosure for this project.

<h3 align="left">To launch the calculator</h3>
To run the project you must import the necessary libraries and modules : RPi.GPIO and time.

<h3 align="left">the creation of the calculator</h3>
for this I wired the Raspberry Pi 4 with the 4x4 keyboard which will allow the user to enter the numbers and the operation he wishes to carry out. 
All this is displayed on an LCD display and to control the contrast of the LCD I used a potentiometer.
